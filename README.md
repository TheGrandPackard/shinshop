# ShinShop Everquest Swiss Army Knife
ShinShop is an EQ editor. The goal is to create a toolkit that lets you download and run a single executable, within the same directory as eqemu_config.xml, and have access to many features previous tools have, without requiring PHP, apache, and other dependencies.
